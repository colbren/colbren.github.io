## I. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence has become an increasingly visible tool in education, especially in fields like Software Engineering where problem solving, design, and iteration are central skills. In ICS 314, AI tools were presented not as a replacement for learning, but as optional aids that students could choose to integrate into their workflow. This made the course a useful environment for experimenting with AI responsibly while still being accountable for understanding the material. Throughout ICS 314, I primarily used ChatGPT (OpenAI), and to a lesser extent tools like GitHub Copilot. I did not rely on AI to complete assignments end-to-end, but instead used it selectively to clarify concepts, generate examples, debug issues, and reflect on my own work. This essay reflects on how AI influenced my learning, when it was helpful, when it was not, and what I learned about my own problem-solving habits as a result.

## II. Personal Experience with AI
Below, I address each required course element and describe how AI was (or was not) used, including examples and reflections on usefulness.

**1. Experience WODs (e.g., E18)**

For Experience WODs, I generally avoided using AI during the actual timed portion because the goal was to practice speed and familiarity under pressure. I usually watched the video and found it more helpful in explaining the solution. However, I sometimes used ChatGPT after completing a WOD to compare my approach. AI was useful for reflection but not during execution. Using it during the WOD would have defeated the purpose of practicing recall and fluency.
Example prompt: “Solve this WOD using functional programming in JavaScript and explain the approach.”

**2. In-class Practice WODs**

During practice WODs, I occasionally used AI to understand why a solution worked or failed. This helped reinforce concepts after attempting the problem myself, but I still made sure to try first without AI.
Example prompt: “Why does this not return the expected result?”

**3. In-class WODs**

I did use AI during some in-class WODs primarily for debugging and error correction rather than for generating full solutions. When my code produced syntax errors or failed ESLint checks, I would paste the relevant snippet and error message into ChatGPT and ask for help identifying the issue.
Example prompt: "How do I implment a dropdown menu in the navbar component?"

**4. Essays**

AI was most useful for essays. I used it to help organize thoughts, improve clarity, and revise tone—not to generate content blindly. This saved time and helped improve readability, but I always edited the output to ensure it reflected my actual experience.
Example prompt: “Change this sentence to be more reflective and less technical.”

**5. Final Project**

For the final project, I used AI as a support tool rather than a solution generator. AI helped me think through design decisions and edge cases, but the implementation and debugging still required hands-on work.
Example prompt: “How would you structure for a guessing game with GPS scoring?”

**6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial**

AI was very helpful when learning new concepts quickly. This was especially useful when documentation felt overwhelming or too verbose.
Example prompt: “Explain ESLint errors related to unused variables and how to fix them.”

**7. Answering a Question in Class or Discord**

I did not use AI to answer questions live in class or on Discord. I felt that responding in my own words was important for engagement and honesty, and AI responses would have been too slow or unnatural in real-time discussion.

**8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question**

AI sometimes helped me form better questions. This helped me learn how to ask more precise and thoughtful questions.
Example prompt: “What is a good clarifying question to ask when a React component rerenders unexpectedly?”

**9. Coding Example**

For coding examples, AI was useful for syntax reminders. This was helpful for quick recall but not something I relied on exclusively.
Example prompt: “Give an example of using underscore .map on an array of objects.”

**10. Explaining Code**

I frequently used AI to explain unfamiliar code. This helped me build understanding more quickly than reading code alone.
Example prompt: “Explain what this function is doing step by step.”

**11. Writing Code**

I used AI occasionally to generate starter code. The output often needed modification, but it helped reduce friction when starting, especially for designing general UIs.
Example prompt: “Write a basic function that calculates distance between two GPS coordinates.”

**12. Documenting Code**

AI was useful for documentation detailing parts of the code making it easier for other developers to understand (helpful in the final project). I still reviewed and edited the comments to ensure accuracy.
Example prompt: “Write concise comments explaining what this function does.”

**13. Quality Assurance**

This was one of the most effective uses of AI. AI often caught obvious issues quickly, saving debugging time. Many things like simple ESLint errors could be easily solved using AI.
Example prompt: “What’s wrong with this code?”

**14. Other Uses in ICS 314**

I also used AI for project write-ups for my professional portfolio helping me articulate what I learned rather than just what I built. 
Example prompt: “Can you expand on how working on a team in engineering projects is equally as important as the technical aspects”

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding
AI enhanced my learning by lowering the barrier to clarification. Instead of getting stuck for long periods, I could quickly validate my understanding and move forward. However, I also learned that overusing AI could reduce retention if I did not actively engage with the solution. The biggest benefit came when AI was used as a second perspective, not a primary source of answers.

## IV. Practical Applications
Outside ICS 314, I have used AI in personal and academic projects to brainstorm architectures, debug issues, and document code. In collaborative settings, AI helped accelerate iteration but still required human judgment to ensure correctness and design quality.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities
One challenge was knowing when not to use AI. It was sometimes tempting to ask for answers instead of struggling productively. A major opportunity lies in teaching students how to use AI responsibly—focusing on prompts for understanding rather than solution dumping.

## VI. Comparative Analysis
Compared to traditional methods, AI-enhanced learning felt more interactive and flexible. Traditional teaching builds fundamentals, while AI helps reinforce and apply them. The best learning experience came from combining both: learning concepts traditionally, then using AI to deepen understanding and refine work.

## VII. Future Considerations
In the future, AI will likely become a standard tool in software engineering education. Courses like ICS 314 are well-positioned to teach not just how to use AI, but when and why. Emphasizing ethical and intentional use will be critical.

## VIII. Conclusion
Overall, AI played a meaningful but balanced role in my experience with ICS 314. It helped me learn faster, reflect more deeply, and improve the quality of my work—when used thoughtfully. My main takeaway is that AI is most valuable as a learning partner, not a shortcut. Used responsibly, it can significantly enhance software engineering education.
