## Why Smart Questions Matter
After reading Eric S. Raymond's article "How to Ask Smart Questions", it became apparent that clarity and context were key factors to being able to receive help. By asking smart questions, you can not only get answers you are seeking to be quicker, but also elevate the conversation to teach both the person asking and answering. This essay explores the importance of smart quewstions and why they matter through real life examples from Stack Overflow.

## The Smart Way

An example of a well-crafted question from Stack Overflow is seen above in [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43260643/how-to-resolve-node-js-error-enoent-no-such-file-or-directory). It is clear that this question has the characteristics of context, clarity, effort displayed, and reproducability to be a smart question. The user asking clearly states his problem, his environment, and his current setup. "I have a Node.js web application currently running on a server successfully. Now I'm trying to set up a local copy on my development server... the server below occurs when I try to start the Node.js server." The title also includes the exact error message they received "Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory". Overall the question has clear context of what is working and how his environment is set up with the exact error message received.

## The Not-So-Smart Way
Although I could not find a specific example on Stack Overflow that was a strong example of a non-smart style question (due to the administration of Stack Overflow), an easy example of questions I commonly ask when I am trying to help other people is "This part of my code causes this error, what could be the problem?". Although I am able to get exactly where the code fails and error message, I often have to follow up to ask what they are trying to achieve and how they implemented different parts of their code to get enough context to help them torubleshoot. It is a lot more effort for the person helping that often times leads to a very low chance of you receiving a helpful answer. 

##  Reflection and Key Insights
Overall there are some key factors that you need to keep in mind when asking questions to receive the best feedback and help as quick as possible. It may not be able to check off all these boxes, however filling most would likely lead to a better answer. I believe the most important and nearly essential components would be the following:
1. Clarity and Detail: Try to put as much context to the issue as possible. This can be things like what you tried, what you used, how you got to this point, and what was last achieved before running into the issue, and what you are trying to achieve
2. Effort Shown: Tried multiple methods to attempt to solve to problem to show that you tried to solve the issue instead of just putting it off on someone else.

## Final Thoughts
Asking smart questions is more than just a way to get faster and better answers, it is a habit that shows professionalism and makes you reflects a highly functioning developer. By asking smart quiestions, it ensures others know that you have already invested thought and effort before seeking someone else's advice. This makes you a more appealing to people as they will believe you would actively collaborate and are not just putting off your work. Even communities online like Stack Overflow share a responsibility to and have a high standard when it comes to asking questions. Asking good questions will make your answer not only more accurate and quick, but will also provide the community of future engineers quick solutions to an array of problems. On the other hand, if you structure your questions poorly, it will waste the time of both parties and even lead to confusion and more steps. This can be extremely frustrating for both parties and in a professional setting, will cause problems in communication and leading people to believe you are an incompetent worker.

AI was used to find links of examples on Stack Overflow properly that included all parts of a smart question (ChatGPT).
