## Learning About the World of Software Engineering

When I first started learning about programming, what impressed me was not only the power to get a computer to do something, but the artistic freedom it allowed. Programming software was like constructing with an unlimited number of Lego bricks: each brick was tiny and uncomplicated, yet with enough creativity, the options were endless. This sense of discovery pulled me deeper into the field of software engineering, where I realized that it's not merely about coding programs, but also about constructing systems that individuals rely on daily--whether it's a web application, an embedded system, or a cloud platform. My first experience with programming dealt with robotic systems as a part of Team Robotic Space Exploration mainly developing a localization stack for autonomous navigation. However, beyond programming embedded systems, I hope to learn more about programming applications and websites through classwork and build other cool projects.

## The Skills That I Would Like to Acquire

In the future, I would like to entrench my roots in theory and practice. On the technical side, I'm eager to get experience in writing scalable, easy-to-maintain code using frameworks like React for client-side programming and Node.js for server-side services. I'm also interested in systems programming using C and C++, where optimizing performance and memory usage is of prime importance. Besides programming languages, I'd like to know more about algorithms, distributed systems, and database design--topics that are the basis of solid software architecture. Alongside this, I would also like to grow as a team engineer. Software is not made by one person anymore, and having the ability to work with version control tools, continuous integration pipelines, and agile development practices is just as important as raw coding skills. Being able to master the art of providing and receiving good code reviews is another skill I would like to get better at, as it makes me write more considerate and readable code.

## Learning Through Experience
I've learned that the best learning occurs by building. Personal projects, internships, or open-source work, I'd like to place myself in a situation where I'm fixing real issues for real users. Solving small runtime exceptions or optimizing a slow query to run faster teaches things that no book can ever completely achieve. For example, one of the recent small projects I worked on was integrating third-party APIs, and I could see right away that documentation is never perfect--being flexible and persistent are skills worth their weight in gold in this line of work. I'm excited about continuing to work on embedded systems within the Robotic Space Exploration group where I integrate sensor data like GPS and IMU to get a better localization stack and improve my programming skills through more hands-on experience.

## Looking Toward the Future
In the end, I hope to be a general-purpose engineer with the capability to build systems from inception to completion, from design to deployment. I wish to do projects that impact--whether improving accessibility in everyday applications, expanding the scope of what robots can do through smarter embedded software, or building tools that help other developers become more productive. Software engineering is a field that rapidly evolves, and I know I will need to continue learning and adapting. Although I am not certain which field in software I would like to work on in the future, I hope my experiences working on different types of projects will help narrow my scope and guide my love for programming.
