## Overview
Manoa Guesser is a location-based guessing game inspired by games like GeoGuessr, but focused specifically on the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa campus. Players are shown an image taken somewhere on campus and must guess the location using an interactive map. Points are awarded based on how close the guess is to the actual location, and scores are tracked through a leaderboard system. The project was developed as part of ICS 314 and served as a full-stack, team-based software engineering experience. While the application is implemented as a web app, the primary goal was to practice real-world software engineering concepts such as collaboration, version control, coding standards, and iterative development.

## My Contributions
My primary contributions focused on the game experience and map integration. I worked on integrating interactive mapping functionality into the game page using Leaflet, allowing users to place guesses directly on a map. I also helped refine the game page layout and styling to improve usability and visual clarity.
In addition, I contributed to features such as:
- Implementing and refining the streak system, including logic tied to the accuracy of a player’s guess
- Improving CSS and layout for the game page to create a more polished user experience
- Fixing and refining parts of the submission and approval flow to ensure smooth gameplay and data consistency
- Improving the admin page to pull from the database and approve/disapprove as well as remove user's submissions
For specific issues I worked on, you can refer to the project manager board located on the GitHub organization. These tasks required coordinating closely with teammates, working through merge conflicts, and adhering to shared coding standards.

## What I learned
This project reinforced that software engineering is not just about writing code, but about building systems that work well with other people’s code. I gained practical experience with:
- Collaborative development using GitHub issues, pull requests, and code reviews
- Configuration management, including managing dependencies and ensuring consistent environments
- UI design trade-offs, balancing functionality with simplicity and clarity
- Incremental development, where features evolved over time rather than being “done” in one pass
I also learned the importance of clear communication and documentation. Many challenges arose not from technical difficulty, but from understanding how different parts of the system interacted and how changes affected teammates’ work. 

## Reflection
Manoa Guesser helped bridge the gap between classroom exercises and real-world software development. Working on a shared codebase with multiple contributors made concepts like coding standards, issue-driven development, and testing feel necessary rather than academic. This project gave me confidence in my ability to contribute meaningfully to larger software systems and prepared me for future team-based engineering projects.
